                        In June 2019, nearly two decades of negotiations between the EU and the Latin American Mercosur bloc concluded in the signing of a trade deal. 
                        Still to be ratified, the EU-Mercosur agreement has attracted strong criticism from diverse actors, from European farmers to environmentalists 
                        and human rights groups. With a focus on Brazil, the Mercosur blocâ€™s biggest member led by far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, 
                        Julia Lagoutte assesses the threats the deal poses to people and planet, and its prospects going forward.
