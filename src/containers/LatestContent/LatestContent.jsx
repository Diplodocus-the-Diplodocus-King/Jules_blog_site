                        A Podcast about Green ideas. In the run up to the general election, we’re getting to grips with the Green Party of England and Wales’ manifesto – 
                        ‘If not now, when?’ – with the people who put it together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is a space where we can explore the philosophy behind the growing political ecology movement. 
                        Green Space is produced by Seden Anlar & Julia Lagoutte – in collaboration with the Green Party of England and Wales.
